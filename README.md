******THINGS TO NOTE WHEN COMMITTING*****

1.COMMITS ARE PRETTY MUCH PERMANENT!!!! Replacing a file causes the previous file to be deleted and a hassle to recover it.
  Feel free to make branches if you are unsure about the committing!!
  BRANCHES ARE SAFER.
  Creating a branch allows you to have your own branch workspace.
  Make the names of branches relevant, for merging purposes please!!!
  Adding new files is not a big deal since there is no deletion of files.

2.Be sure to make sure files make it to the right subdirectory.
  ex: userinterface files go into the userinterface folder.
  You can do this by editing the name of the file when you commit/make a branch.
  At the top of the commit it should show your file names above the code .
  add the directory before the name before you commit.
  ex: addArticleView.java becomes userinterface/addArticleView.java
  or you can click the subdirectory folder you need to add files to and upload the files directly to the subdirectory 
 
3.Test your code before you commit!!!
  DONT ADD BROKEN CODE TO THE REPOSITORY, WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT????
  Next thing you know the app doesnt even run.

******THINGS TO NOTE WHEN TESTING*****

1. Java code needs to be compiled (you all know that right??). You adding your .java class doesnt actually do anything unless its           compiled. coms.txt contains two cmd commands to compile everything. Simply open cmd, change directory to your project directory (point      cmd to your project folder) then paste the two commands into cmd and hit enter. Cmd will report any errors, if so you have some fixing    to do.  That should compile your changes and now you are free to actually run the application and you should see your changes.

2. Becareful with your ide. They add extra imports to work with your workspace. For example, eclipse likes to add an import something like    import sun.stuff.stuff. You need to remove these before committ or else when compiling their will be erros because it cant find the        import.
