******THINGS TO NOTE WHEN COMMITTING*****

1.COMMITS ARE PRETTY MUCH PERMIT!!!! Replacing a file causes the previous file to be deleted and a hastle to recover it.
  Feel free to make branches if you are unsure about the committing!!
  BRANCHES ARE SAFER.
  Creating a branch allows you to have your own branch workspace.
  Make the names of branches relevant, for merging purposes please!!!
  Adding new files is not a big deal since there is no deletion of files.

2.Be sure to make sure files make it to the right subdirectory.
  ex: userinterface files go into the userinterface folder.
  You can do this by editing the name of the file when you commit/make a branch.
  At the top of the commit it should show your file names above the code .
  add the directory before the name before you commit.
  ex: addArticleView.java becomes userinterface/addArticleView.java
 
3.Test your code before you commit!!!
  DONT ADD BROKEN CODE TO THE REPOSITORY, WHATS THE POINT OF THAT????
  Next thing you know the app doesnt even run.
